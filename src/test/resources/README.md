# Exercise 0 > Initial State

Before we begin coding, we'll want to verify that the initial project state is working as expected. From your `sbt` session:

**TODO**: EXPLAIN SETUP

- Verify initial tests pass. You should see something similar to the following:

```scala
[info] DomainTests:
[info] Run completed in 443 milliseconds.
[info] Total number of tests run: 0
[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
[info] Tests: succeeded 0, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
```

- Use `koan next` to move to the next exercise.
